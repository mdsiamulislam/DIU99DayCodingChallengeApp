Introduction to SQLite
SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine commonly embedded in mobile applications, desktop software, and small-scale systems. It is widely used due to its simplicity, reliability, and portability.

Key Features of SQLite
Serverless: SQLite does not require a separate server process; it reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files.
Zero Configuration: No setup or administration is required.
Cross-Platform: Works on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
Lightweight: Small footprint in terms of both size and resource consumption.
Self-Contained: Everything is in a single library file.
How SQLite Works
SQLite stores its entire database in a single cross-platform file. Here's a step-by-step overview of its functionality:

1. Database Creation
SQLite database is created as a single .sqlite or .db file using a command or programmatically.
Command:

sql
Copy code
sqlite3 mydatabase.db
This creates a new SQLite database named mydatabase.db.

2. Table Creation
Tables are used to organize data in rows and columns.

SQL Example:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
3. Data Insertion
Data is added to the database using INSERT statements.

SQL Example:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO users (name, email)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
4. Data Querying
Data is retrieved using SELECT statements.

SQL Example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe';
5. Data Modification
Update or delete records using UPDATE and DELETE commands.

SQL Example:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE users
SET email = 'john.doe@example.com'
WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 1;
6. Transactions
SQLite supports transactions to ensure data integrity.

SQL Example:

sql
Copy code
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO users (name, email)
VALUES ('Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com');

COMMIT;
7. Closing the Database
When a database operation is complete, the connection can be closed (in programming).

Common SQLite Commands
List all tables:
sql
Copy code
.tables
View table schema:
sql
Copy code
.schema table_name
Exit SQLite shell:
sql
Copy code
.exit
Advantages of SQLite
Simplicity: Easy to set up and use.
Portability: The database file can be copied and used across systems.
Performance: Optimized for read-heavy operations.
Limitations
Not suitable for high-concurrency, large-scale applications.
No user management or access control.
Practical Applications of SQLite
Mobile applications (e.g., Android, iOS).
Browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Embedded systems.
Local application data storage.
